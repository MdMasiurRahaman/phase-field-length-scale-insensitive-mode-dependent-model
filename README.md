# A phase-field length scale insensitive mode-dependent fracture model for brittle failure


This article presents a consistent phase-field length scale insensitive mode-dependent fracture model for brittle failure by proposing mode-factor dependent degradation functions 
that incorporate the effect of two additional fracture parameters, namely the mode-II critical energy release rate and mode-II fracture strength, on the overall mechanical response.
Using the proposed mode-factor dependent degradation functions and employing a recently proposed modified strain decomposition scheme, we provide analytical expressions for the mode-I 
and mode-II fracture strengths corresponding to the mode-dependent parts of the elastic energy. Adopting a modified Benzeggagh–Kenane (B–K) criteria, we propose mode-dependent driving 
forces by deriving expressions for the critical energy release rate corresponding to individual fracture modes. The proposed model provides a consistent coupling between the different 
fracture modes and can thus predict fracture for all possible mode-mixity ratios. A parametric study is carried out to unravel the effect of mixed-mode fracture parameters on the
mechanical response of isotropic materials by considering a few representative numerical examples. The numerical results from the proposed model show an excellent agreement with 
experimental results reported in the literature.
